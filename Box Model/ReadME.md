#Box Model
box model me hame padding border aur margin ke baare me samajh milti hai 


Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

Important: When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the total width and height of an element, you must also include the padding and borders.

border aur content ke beech me padding hoti hai 
and border ke bahar waale space ko hum margin bolte hai
